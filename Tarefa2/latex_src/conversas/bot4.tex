Hello! I'm the calculator bot, you can send me things to calculate. Here are a few examples: \\ \\
'1+1'
'9*38(139.192/123,3)' \\ \\
And so on... it's also possible to type like a normal person like: \\ \\
'1 plus 1' \\
'9 times 38 (129.192 divided by 123,3)' \\
'square root of 4' \\
Or even 'hello tell me what is 1 multiplied by 12983.32 divided by 9 \\ \\
So you can replace
+ with 'plus', \\
- with 'minus' \\
/ with 'divided by', \\
* with 'times' or 'x' or 'multiplied by', \\
\textasciicircum with 'to the power of', \\
root with 'square root' and 
\% with 'mod' \\
The bot also has the following functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, log \\
Example: 'sin 45 plus log 19 - (8 \textasciicircum sin 45)' \\ \\
Goodluck!}
